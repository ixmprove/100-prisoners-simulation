# 100 Prisoners Problem - Simulation
## Intallation
- `$ git clone https://github.com/ixmprove/100-prisoners-simulation.git`  
- `$ cd 100-prisoners-simulation`  
- `$ python3 simulation.py 1000`  
*(There is one argument which specifies the amount of simulations)*
## Why?
I could not believe that it was possible to have a 30% probability to win the game of the [100 prisoners problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem "Explanation of the game and the strategy to increase the odds.").
So I've decided to put the strategy to a test, and simulate the strategy to see it in action.
